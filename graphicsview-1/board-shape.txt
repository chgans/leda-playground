Edit mode:
- end points:
  - Moving vertex: the end point is moved around, adjacent elements are updated
  - Mitering to segment: A segment is inserted, it's mid point belongs to the 
    angle diagonal, the segment is normal to this diagonal, it's endpoints are
    at the intersection of the adjacent element path with the segment.
  - Mitering to arc: 
- mid points:
  - Moving edge: Path element keep same size/shape, both end points are moved
    by cursor dx/dy
  - Breaking edge: the midpoint becomes a new end point, 2 new elements are 
    inserted on left and right, the type of the new elements is the type of 
    the element the mid point belongs to.
  - Incurvating edge: The element being edited becomes an arcTo if it wasn't 
    already so, the endpoints don't moved, the center of the arc belongs to 
    the normal at the center point of the original element.
- Rest of the path: 
  - Sliding edge: 
    - LineTo: move the endpoints keeping the line's angle
    - ArcTo: move the enpoints keeping cord's angle
    
+ Live snapping when the edited *end* point is align with 90/45 to other end 
  points, or belongs to the perimeter of the full circle of an arc.
  
  
  Create mode:
  Shift-space: Cycle through:
   - Any angle, 
   - Line 45/90, 
   - Line 45/90 with arcs (Radius=?), 
   - Line 90/90 vertical start, 
   - Line 90/90 vertical start with arcs
   
  Control-space: 
   - Line 45/90 <=> Line 90/45
   - line 45/90 with arcs <=> line 90/45 with arcs
   - Line 90/90 vertical start <=> Line 90/90 horizontal start
   - Line 90/90 vertical start with arcs <=> Line 90/90 horizontal start with arcs
