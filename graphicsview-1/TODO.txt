{SCH,SCHLIB,PCB,PCBLIB}List:
Purpose:
 {view|Edit}
 {all|non-masked|selected} objects
 from {current component|all library},
 includes {all types|only [...]}
 => display table of objects
Note:
 Applies to graphical objects only

{SCH,SCHLIB,PCB,PCBLIB}Filter:
Purpose:
 From {All|Selected|not-selected} objects
 of {current|open|open of same project|Any of same project}
 Find items matching the criteria {Query string}
 => {select/zoom} matching objects
 => {deselect/mask out} non matching objects

{SCH,SCHLIB,PCB,PCBLIB}Inspector:
Purpose:
 From selected objects

 => display table of object(s) properties

Graphics Views:
0) Editor's view
- The document view for SCH, SCHLIB, PCB and PCLIB

- Project insight: shows visual of all documents of the project when the mouse hovers the project's
  icon in the project explorer
- Document insight: As above but show only the document's own visual when the mouse hovers the
  document's icon in the project explorer
- Connectivity insight: shows visual of the hovered electrical object within it's document and
  other project documents in the editor's view (SCH only)
2) Board insight (http://techdocs.altium.com/display/ADOH/Working+with+the+Board+Insight+System)
- Board insight pop-up: Show visual of the hovered object (single or multiple primitive)

 - interactive vs non-interactive vs level of interaction (zoom, select, move, ...)
